Data required: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mqoh7gG-g3Sc3Zh6zEO8o2sKBpdSeFiJ/view
Instructions to run code
* There are two files: AML Compiled and Analysis for ML Coursework
* Each require data, accessed by the link above. 
```
df = pd.read_csv("/location/of/file") --> analysis variable
read_data = pd.read_csv("/location/of/file") --> AML variable
```
* Once the data is imported, both notebooks can be ran providing analysis and results of all four models. If using Google Colab, all required installs are prewritten.
* The conclusion of the AML Compiled notebook requires external data from kaggle for testing on a different dataset. Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification
